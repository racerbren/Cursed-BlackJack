# Cursed-BlackJack is a work in progress, online blackjack game.

This game, in its current state, allows up to two people to play against each other on the same local network as well as single player games against the dealer.
In the future, this game will support betting, statistics through database implementation, and "cursed" features which include unconventional blackjack rules such
as changing card values mid game, hiding cards up your sleeve, and many others. This can be thought of as the cheater's edition of blackjack.

The tutorial for running and setting up this game is very simple:
1. Run the server.py file one time
2. Run an individual client through the command prompt and select multiplayer
3. Run another client either on the same computer through a secondary command prompt, or on another device on the same network and select multiplayer
4. The game is ready to play!
